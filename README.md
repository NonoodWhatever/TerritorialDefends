Pain

Anyway, Welcome to my programming project game.

This is from ReadmeThing from actual file game.
This project is a pain when you don't know much about what to go.

Enemy here doesn't spawn in wave and enemy don't go to player directly, I seem to be able to see the solution, 
but for this version. It is what it is.
The horde of enemy that appears later DOES come to the player, they're just fast and have no drag.
Player can die so that's nice.
The Resolution is also broken, but fullscreen is not, I recommend playing with fullscreen off.
Press ESC key at any point to get out of the game.



I RECOMMEND that you reduce the volume. as it WILL get loud.
I am not responsible for any destroyed pants.
