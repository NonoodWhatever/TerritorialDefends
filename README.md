Pain

Anyway, Welcome to my programming project game. currently, things do not works properly.

This is from ReadmeThing from actual file game.

This project is a pain when you don't know much about what to go.

The Resolution is also slightly broken when the screen isn't fulled. I recommend playing with fullscreen ON.



I RECOMMEND that you either reduce the volume or not touching the volume bar. as it WILL get loud.
I am not responsible for any destroyed pants.
